# MIHU
Product Based Capstone Bangkit 2023, The repository constains Android App which is implemented with xml for the layout, MVVM, and and integrating the api for predicting category with query to the machine learning model.

In mobile development, applications for recruiters and workers follow the MVVM architecture. The Model handles data and logic, connecting to a backend API, while the ViewModel manages presentation logic with LiveData for real-time updates. The View represents the interface, kept separate from business logic. A ViewModelFactory aids instance creation, and a Repository pattern ensures smooth data flow. Integrated with a deployed model, this approach delivers a streamlined and intelligent user experience for recruiters and workers.
